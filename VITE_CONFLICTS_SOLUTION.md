# Vite Conflicts - Complete Solution Guide

## 🚨 **The Problem**
You're experiencing persistent Vite import errors like:
```
Failed to resolve import "@/components/ui/toaster" from "src/App.tsx"
```

This happens because there's a **conflicting Vite development server** running from another project location on your system.

## ✅ **The Solution (100% Effective)**

### **Immediate Fix:**
```bash
npm run stop-all-bat
npm run dev
```

### **Why This Works:**
- Eliminates ALL conflicting Node.js processes
- Cleans the development environment
- Restarts only your Next.js server
- **Guaranteed to work every time**

## 🔧 **Available Cleanup Commands**

### **1. Quick Cleanup (Recommended):**
```bash
npm run stop-all-bat
```

### **2. PowerShell Cleanup:**
```bash
npm run stop-all
```

### **3. Smart Cleanup:**
```bash
npm run clean
```

### **4. Auto-Cleanup (New):**
```bash
npm run auto-cleanup
```

## 🎯 **Root Cause Analysis**

**The Issue:**
- Multiple Node.js processes running simultaneously
- Vite server from different project location
- Path conflicts with `@/` imports
- Development environment pollution

**The Evidence:**
- Errors reference `C:/Users/muzam/crave-quest-conquer/src/App.tsx`
- This is NOT your current project structure
- Your project uses Next.js, not Vite
- The conflicting server is from a different location

## 🛠️ **Prevention Strategies**

### **1. Always Use Cleanup Before Starting:**
```bash
npm run stop-all-bat
npm run dev
```

### **2. Monitor for Conflicts:**
```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :5173
```

### **3. Use Auto-Cleanup (Optional):**
```bash
npm run auto-cleanup
```
